# File-System-Organiser-Node-JS-app
A NodeJS application which will allow users to:
1. organise files in a directory by categorisation algorithms
2. generate tree structured representation of the desired directory for clarity and less ambiguity
3. aid to use the app

Runs across the system globally because of using Shebang. Handles exceptions and invalid inputs well.
